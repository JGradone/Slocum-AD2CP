# Slocum-AD2CP

Slocum-AD2CP is a package designed to process Nortek AD2CP data from Teledyne Webb Research Slocum gliders. The package is designed to walk through the steps to process AD2CP data in several Jupyter notebooks.

Please cite this package using this DOI. The intention for publishing this code on GitHub is twofold: 1) to make glider based acoustic current profiler data easier to work with and 2) to improve upon the processing workflow and make it more transparent. For these reasons, I encourage comments, questions, concerns, and for users of this code to report any potential bugs. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me at jgradone@marine.rutgers.edu.

The major steps are as follows:
----------------------

Processing Raw AD2CP Data
----------------------
This package is built under the assumption that users are processing their AD2CP data to NetCDFs using the Nortek MIDAS software.
